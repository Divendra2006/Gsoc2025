# **Interactive Visualization**
---
## **Easy Solution**

### **Overview**
- Demonstrates the use of the Liminal package for interactive visualization.
- Utilizes **linked brushing** to explore relationships between t-SNE embedding and a grand tour.

### **Key Features**
- **Dimensionality Reduction** : t-SNE to analyze data
- **Interactive Visualization** : Linked brushing to understand cluster structures and possible distortions.

## **Medium Solution**

### **Overview**
- Implements a Shiny app using the Detourr package for interactive 2D scatter plots.
- Analyzes the flea dataset with two different tour paths: grand_tour and little_tour.
- Utilizes a linking brush to highlight corresponding data points across different tour views.

### **Key Features**
- **Linked Brushing** : Display both tours side by side with linked brushing between the two views to explore relationships within the data.
- **Tour Techniques** : Compares grand tour and little tour methods.

### **Visualization of Linking & Brushing**
We display two different 2D projections of the dataset using **grand tour** and **little tour** techniques.
